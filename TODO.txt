Improve pursuit estimation for if pursuer has less maxSpeed

Add different scenarios to show off different behaviors:
    Needed features
        Display text
        event pubsub to keep track of collisions for example
        keyboard input to change scenarios
        scenarios stored in some way, probably just functions in Game.js
    Scenarios
        Classic flocking and variations
        "Curser circle ritual" from Game.js
        Different 
        Seek vs Pursue
            average distance from target
            number of collisions with target
        Flee vs Evade
            average distance from target
            number of collisions with target

Add "Avoid" steering behavior, similar to separate but looks ahead to predict colision, and move just enough to avoid reliably. Look at Craig Reynold's for inspiration.

implement AI architectures:
    finite state machine
        prey looks for food and sticks together
        predator wanders for prey then attacks prey
    behavior tree
    GAIA

look into blackboard tech
use quadtree for finding neighbors
