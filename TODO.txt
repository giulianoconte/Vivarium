Improve pursuit estimation for if pursuer has less maxSpeed

Bug: classic flocking scenario averages right, why?

Scenarios:
    Set entity stats differently based on scenarios
    Give scenario access to
    UI instructions for changing scenarios

Add different scenarios to show off different behaviors:
    Needed features
        Display text
        event pubsub to keep track of collisions for example
    Scenarios
        Classic flocking
            within circle
            with predators
            with moving obstacles
        "Curser circle ritual" from Game.js
        Seek vs Pursue
            average distance from target
            number of collisions with target
        Flee vs Evade
            average distance from target
            number of collisions with target
        Arrive freezing entities around mouse cursor

Fix super long navigation desire rendering

Add "Avoid" steering behavior, similar to separate but looks ahead to predict colision, and move just enough to avoid reliably. Look at Craig Reynold's for inspiration.

implement AI architectures:
    finite state machine
        prey looks for food and sticks together
        predator wanders for prey then attacks prey
    behavior tree
    GAIA

look into blackboard tech
use quadtree for finding neighbors
