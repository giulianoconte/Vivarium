implement collision detection

Improve pursuit estimation for if pursuer has less maxSpeed

implement AI architectures:
    finite state machine
        prey looks for food and sticks together
        predator wanders for prey then attacks prey
    behavior tree
    GAIA

look into blackboard tech
use quadtree for finding neighbors
